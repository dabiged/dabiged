Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->
- 🔭 I’m currently working on 
1. Writing Reinforcement learning algorithms for AIGym problems.
2. [TameTheTemp](https://unearthed.solutions/u/competitions/tame-the-temp): the unearthed solutions data science competition. I am looking at using LSTM networks to solve this problem.
3. Writing a Navier-Stokes computational fluid dynamics tutorial in [devito](https://github.com/devitocodes/devito)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Reinforcement Learning via David Silver's 2015 class.
- 💬 Ask me about Reservoir Simulation, Seismic Processing, Machine Learning or Natural Language Processing.
